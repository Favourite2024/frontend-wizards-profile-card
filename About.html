      <p>
        Hello! I'm Favour Onyinyechi Udeh, a passionate Frontend Developer dedicated to creating accessible, 
        responsive, and human-centered digital experiences. My journey into web development began with a 
        curiosity about how beautiful and functional websites are built, and it has grown into a deep 
        commitment to crafting intuitive user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that great design should be accessible to everyone, which is why I focus on building 
        applications that are not only visually appealing but also inclusive and easy to use. When I'm not 
        coding, you'll find me creating content, swimming, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

    <!-- CONFIDENCE SECTION -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        Growth comes from acknowledging our weaknesses and working to improve them. Here are areas where 
        I'm actively working to build confidence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Advanced JavaScript Concepts:</strong> While I'm comfortable with the basics, topics like 
          closures, prototypes, and asynchronous patterns sometimes still challenge me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backend Integration:</strong> I want to become more confident in working with APIs, 
          understanding server-side logic, and handling data flow between frontend and backend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> I'm learning to identify and fix performance bottlenecks, 
          but I know there's much more to master in this area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>System Design:</strong> Architecting large-scale applications and making the right technical 
          decisions is something I'm still developing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I see these challenges not as obstacles, but as opportunities to grow and become a more well-rounded 
        developer.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-envelope-open-text"></i> Note to Future Self</h2>
      <div class="quote-box">
        <p>
          Dear Future Favour,
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember this momentâ€”the excitement, the nervousness, the determination. You started this journey 
          because you believed in your potential to create meaningful digital experiences. No matter how 
          challenging the road ahead becomes, hold onto that belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every bug you debug, every feature you build, and every concept you master is bringing you closer 
          to your dreams. Don't compare your progress to others; your journey is uniquely yours. Celebrate 
          the small wins, learn from the setbacks, and never stop being curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stay humble, stay hungry, and keep building. The tech world needs your perspective, your creativity, 
          and your dedication. You've got this! ðŸ’œ
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 1rem;">
          â€” Favour, October 2025

    <!-- EXTRA THOUGHTS SECTION -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the technical skills, this program represents something deeper for meâ€”a commitment to continuous 
        learning and self-improvement. I've learned that being a great developer isn't just about writing code; 
        it's about empathy for users, collaboration with teams, and the willingness to adapt to new technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly excited about contributing to projects that make a real difference in people's lives. 
        Whether it's improving accessibility for users with disabilities, creating educational platforms, or 
        building tools that solve everyday problems, I want my work to have purpose and impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        To my fellow Frontend Wizards: let's learn together, support each other, and build amazing things. 
        Here's to the journey ahead! ðŸš€âœ¨
